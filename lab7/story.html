    <h1>Cashback</h1>
    <main>
      <p>
        I remember once that I need some cash to do something. But I don't have
        a debit card yet at that time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I told my friends my need, he told me you could go to any supermarket
        and get some cashback when you checkout. But my English is really bad
        since that's my first year here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I went to the market, and during checkout, I asked the cashier: "do
        you guys have trash back?"
      </p>
      <p>The young lady was visibly confused and said "What?"</p>
      <p>I replied louder: "trash back?"</p>
      <p>She said: "do you need trashbags? it's in aisle 13."</p>
      <p>
        I was confused too, "They put cash on the shelf? They do trust their
        customer tho".Then went to aisle 3 found nothing just go back to my
        place with 0 cash.
